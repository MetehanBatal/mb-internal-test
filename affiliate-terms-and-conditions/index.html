		<h1>Affiliate and Promoters Terms and Conditions</h1>
		<h2>
		    PLEASE READ THESE AFFILIATE TERMS CAREFULLY.
		</h2>
		<p>
		    These Terms and Conditions (“Terms”) supplement the Insertion Order (“IO”)
		    and Advertising Rules (“Advertising Rules”) between Pattern Brands, LLC
		    (“Us” or “Our” or “We” or “Client”) and the Promotor listed on the IO (“You”
		    or “Your” or “Promotor”) (collectively, “Agreement”). It describes how we
		    will work together and other aspects of our business relationship. This
		    Agreement applies to your participation in our Affiliate Program (the
		    “Affiliate Program”).
		</p>
		<p>
		    We periodically update this Agreement. We might also choose to replace these
		    Terms in their entirety if, for example, the Affiliate Program changes,
		    ends, or becomes part of an existing program, including our partner
		    programs. If we update or replace these Terms, We will let you know via
		    electronic means, which may be by email. If you don’t agree to the update or
		    replacement, you can choose to terminate as we describe below.
		</p>

		    <li class="heading">
		        BACKGROUND.
		    </li>
		    <p>
		        Promotor operates a network of entities (“Publishers”) to
		        assist in the promotion of products and services by displaying clients’
		        ads, text links, or product links on websites, in e-mail campaigns, or
		        in search listings by and through which Promotor has the contractual
		        right to display or deliver advertisements (“Promotor’s Network”).
		        Client wishes to use Promotor and the Promotor’s Network to advertise
		        the offerings set forth on the IO. Pursuant to the IO, Promotor agrees
		        to distribute Client’s advertising material and promotions by and
		        through the Promotor Network in accordance with the specifications
		        described in the IO (“Campaign”). In this Agreement, the term “Business
		        Day” shall mean the days between and including Monday to Friday, and
		        excludes weekends and public bank holidays recognized by banks located
		        within the United States (“Business Days’”).
		    </p>
		    <li class="heading">
		       ADVERTISING MATERIALS.
		   </li>
		   <p>
		       Client may provide Promotor certain copy, text,
		        banners, buttons, text-links, underlying URLs, co-registration paths,
		        pop-ups, pop-unders, subject lines and artwork for promotional e-mail,
		        graphic files and similar online media (collectively, “Ad Materials”)
		        for Promotor to run the Campaign. Unless restricted by the terms and
		        conditions of the IO, Promotor and its Publishers may create and provide
		        other advertising and marketing copy and creative materials to promote
		        Client’s products provided that (a) all Promotor Ads (as defined below)
		        must first be delivered for Client’s approval to Client at
		        <a href="mailto:marketingapprovals@miraclebrand.co">
		            marketingapprovals@miraclebrand.co
		        </a>
		        (or such other designee whom Client designates) and (b) Client provides
		        express written approval of the Promotor Ads before it is published or
		        otherwise distributed by Promotor or its Publishers. Advertisements
		        using any Ad Materials (“Ads”) may be prepared by or on behalf of Client
		        independent of Promotor or its Publishers and delivered to Promotor
		        (“Client Ads”) and Ads prepared by or on behalf of Promotor or its
		        Publisher (“Promotor Ads”). Promotor and its Publishers may not use any
		        other materials to promote Client’s products other than Client Ads and
		        Promotor Ads that have been approved by Client. No material changes
		        shall be made to any Ads without Client’s prior written consent.
		        Promotor must obtain Client’s express written permission to publish or
		        list any Ads with any other advertising agency or network. In the event
		        that Client instructs Promotor to cease using certain Ads, Promotor and
		        its Publishers shall cease all use within one (1) Business Day. In
		        providing the services under this Agreement, Promotor shall, and shall
		        ensure its Publishers, at all times comply with all Applicable Laws
		        (defined below) as well as the Advertising Rules attached as Appendix A
		        and incorporated by reference herein (the “Advertising Rules”). Client
		        agrees to allow Promotor to make formatting changes to the Client Ads
		        that are reasonably necessary for the sole purpose and intent of
		        matching it to the medium of delivery and Promotor acknowledges and
		        agrees that Promotor and its Publishers shall make no changes whatsoever
		        to any content, claims, or imagery in the Client Ads without prior
		        written approval of Client. Promotor will distribute Ads and market the
		        Campaign using its technology infrastructure and the Promotor Network.
		    </p>
		    <li class="heading">
		        PAYMENT FOR SERVICES.
		    </li>
		    <ol>
		        <li>
		            <strong>Invoicing.</strong> Promotor shall invoice Client in accordance with the
		            details set forth on the IO, and all payments shall become due as
		            set forth in the IO; provided, that, if no payment details are set
		            forth in the IO then Client will pay Promotor within sixty (60) days
		            following the date Client receives the applicable invoice.
		            Notwithstanding any language elsewhere to the contrary, Promotor
		            agrees that Client may withhold any payments that it disputes in
		            good faith until such time as such good faith dispute is resolved.
		            Unless expressly agreed otherwise in the IO, all amounts invoiced
		            will be invoiced, due, and payable in U.S. dollars.
		        </li>
		        <li>
		            <strong>CPA Sales Generation Campaigns.</strong> This section applies only to
		            Campaigns that are cost-per-action/acquisitions (“CPA”) sales
		            generation campaigns which may include, but shall not be limited to,
		            users signing up for an email newsletter, users entering a contest,
		            users registering on a website, users completing a survey, users
		            downloading trial software, or users printing a coupon, and monetary
		            transactions completed by end user making a purchase by using a
		            credit card or alternative payment method (“Sales Generation
		            Campaigns”). A “Sale” is defined as a monetary transaction completed
		            by an end user making a purchase by using a credit card or any
		            alternative payment method as a result of Promotor or its
		            Publishers. An “Action” means a Sale that Client deems, in its sole
		            discretion, to be invalid, refunded, fraudulent, or otherwise not
		            eligible to be counted as a CPA. Notwithstanding anything to
		            contrary in the Agreement, under no circumstances shall Client be
		            liable to pay or reimburse Promotor in any way for a Sale that is a
		            failed transaction, a failed checkout, otherwise incomplete, or
		            appears to have been generated by fraud, a violation of applicable
		            law, or a violation of the Advertising Rules attached hereto.
		            Further, Client shall not be liable to pay or reimburse Promotor in
		            any way for a Sale where the consumer is not presented with an Ad by
		            Promotor and/or Publishers and then affirmatively clicks on the
		            tracking link contained in the same. If Client learns that Promotor
		            or its Publishers may not be in compliance with the terms of this
		            Agreement, Client’s rights include without limitation the right to
		            (a) immediately terminate this Agreement without additional
		            liability, (b) refuse to pay for any payable Actions attributable to
		            the Promotor’s and/or its Publisher’s non-compliance, (c) require
		            Promotor to terminate a specific Publisher, and/or (d) collect any
		            and all monetary damages and obtain other legal remedies against
		            Promotor or the Publisher for the injury resulting to Client from
		            the non-compliance, with rights of set-off and reimbursement of
		            Client’s attorneys’ fees and other legal costs related to the
		            non-compliance. Upon termination of a Publisher by Client, Promotor
		            may not assign a new identification reference to the terminated
		            Publisher or take any other means to circumvent Client’s termination
		            of the Publisher.
		        </li>
		        <li>
		            <strong>CPM Campaigns.</strong> This section applies only to Campaigns that are
		            cost-per-thousand (“CPM”) campaigns (“CPM Campaigns”), which are
		            billed on the number of display ad impressions or email messages
		            delivered. A CPM Campaign may consist of display advertising,
		            advertising in social media, and/or email marketing, as specified in
		            the IO. For CPM Campaigns, Client shall pay for each impression,
		            social media advertisement or impression, and/or email delivered by
		            Promotor and Promotor shall invoice Client based on Promotor’s
		            impression, social media advertisement or impression, and/or email
		            counts. In the event of a discrepancy between Promotor’s counts of
		            impressions, social media advertisements or impressions, and email
		            counts and those of Client, the parties shall cooperate in good
		            faith to reconcile the reports and make the applicable account
		            adjustments, however if the parties cannot agree to such
		            reconciliation then the Client’s CPM counts shall control.

		            Date set forth in the IO, or if no Expiration Date is set forth in
		            the IO, then the term of the Agreement shall continue until the

		        </li>
		        <li>
		            <strong>Termination.</strong> Notwithstanding the foregoing, Client may terminate the
		            Agreement for any reason upon two (2) Business Days’ prior written
		            notice. Without terminating the Agreement, Client may pause Campaign
		            or traffic from specific Publishers upon one (1) Business Day notice
		            to Promotor, and Promotor shall ensure such pause occurs. For
		            purposes of this section, notice may be sent by email to the party’s
		            account representative specified in the IO (or to such other account
		            representative that a party may specify in writing from time to
		            time), and shall be effective one (1) Business Day after it is sent.
		            Unless Client terminates this Agreement, Promotor shall not suspend
		            services until the end of the term.
		        </li>

		            1, this 4.3, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 shall survive termination of this

		            Promotor hereby agrees that Client shall own, and Promotor hereby
		            assigns, and shall cause all Publishers to assign, to Client, all
		            right, title and interest (including without limitation all patent,
		            copyright, trademark, trade secret and all other intellectual
		            property and proprietary rights) in and to all deliverables and all
		            other work product, materials and information which is created by or
		            on behalf of Promotor or Client in the course of its performance of
		            this Agreement, whether produced solely or jointly with others
		            (collectively, the “Work Product”). Promotor irrevocably waives its
		            moral rights in any Work Product. To the extent any deliverable
		            includes previously existing material that was produced prior to or
		            independent of performance of the services and that is owned by
		            Promotor or a third party, Promotor hereby grants to Client, or
		            shall obtain for the benefit of Client, a perpetual, worldwide,
		            royalty free, paid-up, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable,
		            sub-licensable license to use such material to the extent it is
		            incorporated in such deliverable. Promotor agrees to give Client,
		            and any person designated by Client, reasonable assistance, at
		            Client’s expense, required to perfect the rights defined in this
		            section.

		            <strong>Confidential Information.</strong> Promotor acknowledges that in the course
		            of performing services under this Agreement, Promotor may be exposed
		            to or acquire information that is proprietary or confidential to
		            Client, its customers, suppliers, and consumers. Promotor agrees to
		            hold such information in strict confidence and not disclose such
		            information to third parties or use such information for any
		            purposes whatsoever, other than as necessary to perform Promotor’s
		            obligations under this Agreement, without the express written
		            permission of Client. Without limiting the foregoing, Promotor shall
		            be permitted to disclose Confidential Information only to its
		            officers, employees, and subcontractors who have a need to know such
		            Confidential Information in order to fulfill Promotor’s contractual
		            obligations to Client and who are informed of and agree to be bound
		            by this Agreement. As used herein, “Confidential Information” shall
		            mean, without limitation: (a) all information disclosed by Client or
		            otherwise furnished to Promotor, whether orally or in writing, that
		            is designated or marked as confidential or that reasonably should be
		            understood by a reasonable person to be confidential given the
		            nature of the information and the circumstances of the disclosure;
		            (b) trade secrets, inventions, ideas, processes, formulas, source
		            and object codes, data, programs, other works of authorship,
		            know-how, improvements, discoveries, developments, designs and
		            techniques; (c) information regarding plans for new products,
		            marketing and selling, business plans, budgets, prices and costs,
		            suppliers and customers; and (d) the terms and conditions of the IO.
		            Promotor shall use its best efforts to assist Client in identifying
		            and preventing any unauthorized use or disclosure of any
		            Confidential Information. Without limiting the foregoing, Promotor
		            shall immediately advise Client in the event that it learns or has
		            reason to believe that any person who has had access to Confidential
		            Information has violated or intends to violate the terms of this
		            Agreement, and shall reasonably cooperate in seeking injunctive
		            relief against any such person. As between Client and Promotor,
		            Confidential Information is and shall remain the sole property of
		            Client. Promotor shall not gain any interest or rights in or to the
		            Confidential Information by virtue of its being disclosed to
		            Promotor for the limited purposes contemplated under this Agreement.
		        </li>
		        <li>
		            <strong>Required Disclosure.</strong> Notwithstanding the obligations set forth in
		            the immediately preceding section, Promotor shall be permitted to
		            disclose Confidential Information hereunder solely to the extent the
		            same is required to be disclosed pursuant to a subpoena, court
		            order, or government authority, whereupon Promotor shall provide
		            prompt written notice to Client prior to such disclosure, so that
		            Client may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy.

		        General Terms
		    </li>
		    <ol>
		        <li>
		            <strong>Compliance with Applicable Laws.</strong>  You shall comply, and shall ensure
		            that any third parties performing activities on your behalf comply,
		            with all applicable foreign and domestic laws (including without
		            limitation export laws and laws applicable to sending of unsolicited
		            email), governmental regulations, ordinances, and judicial
		            administrative orders. You shall not engage in any deceptive,
		            misleading, illegal or unethical marketing activities, or activities
		            that otherwise may be detrimental to us, our customers, or to the
		            public. Export laws and regulations of the United States and any
		            other relevant local export laws and regulations may apply to Client
		            and/or Client’s products. You will comply with the sanctions
		            programs administered by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)
		            of the US Department of the Treasury.  You will not directly or
		            indirectly export, re-export, or transfer Client products to
		            prohibited countries or individuals or permit use of Client products
		            by prohibited countries or individuals.
		        </li>
		        <li>
		            <strong>Amendments.</strong> This Agreement shall be modified only by a written
		            agreement executed by both Parties and by persons authorized to
		            execute agreements on behalf of the Parties. Any other terms or
		            conditions included in any click-throughs, order acknowledgments,
		            invoices, or other documents utilized or exchanged by the Parties
		            shall not be binding on the Parties hereto.
		        </li>
		        <li>
		            <strong>Independent Contractors.</strong> The status of Promotor will be that of
		            independent contractor of Client, and Promotor and its employees,
		            contractors and agents will not be deemed employees or agents of
		            Client. None of the terms set forth in this Agreement will be
		            construed as creating a partnership, joint venture, agency,
		            master-servant, employment, trust, or any other relationship between
		            Promotor and Client or any of their employees.
		        </li>
		        <li>
		            <strong>No Licenses.</strong> We grant to you only the rights and licenses expressly
		            stated in this Agreement, and you receive no other rights or
		            licenses with respect to us, our products, our trademarks, or any
		            other property or right of ours.
		        </li>
		        <li>
		            <strong>Governing Law.</strong> This Agreement will be governed by and interpreted in
		            accordance with the laws of Delaware, to the exclusion of its
		            conflict of laws provisions. Any legal action brought under or in
		            connection with the subject matter of this Agreement shall be
		            brought only in the United States District Court for Delaware or, if
		            such court would not have jurisdiction over the matter, then only in
		            a Delaware state court. Except as provided in Section 10.4, each
		            party submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of these courts and
		            agrees not to commence any legal action under or in connection with
		            the subject matter of this Agreement in any other court or forum.
		        </li>
		        <li>
		            <strong>Injunctive Relief.</strong> A breach of Promotor’s obligations under this
		            Agreement will result in irreparable injury to Client for which
		            there is no adequate remedy at law. Therefore, notwithstanding
		            Section 9.5, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of such
		            obligations, Client shall be entitled to equitable relief in
		            addition to its other available legal remedies in a court of
		            competent jurisdiction.
		        </li>
		        <li>
		            <strong>Actions Permitted.</strong> Except for actions for nonpayment or breach of a
		            party’s proprietary rights, no action, regardless of form, arising
		            out of or relating to this Agreement may be brought by Publisher
		            more than one (1) year after the cause of action has accrued.
		        </li>
		        <li>
		           <strong> Entire Agreement;</strong> Amendment; Waiver. This Agreement, including the
		            IO and the Advertising Rules referred to in this Agreement,
		            constitute the entire and exclusive statement with respect to its
		            subject matter and supersedes any and all oral or written
		            representations, understandings, or agreements relating thereto.
		            Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall affect or
		            terminate ongoing rights from non-disclosure agreements entered into
		            by the parties prior to the Effective Date. No waiver regarding any
		            breach of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other
		            breach. Any delay by a party in exercising in any respect any right
		            provided for in this Agreement, shall not be deemed a waiver of the
		            subject right or any further right under this Agreement.
		        </li>
		        <li>
		            <strong>Binding Agreement.</strong> This Agreement shall be binding on and inure to
		            the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
		            permitted assigns.
		        </li>
		        <li>
		            <strong>Assignment.</strong> Any assignment of this Agreement or any rights or
		            obligations hereunder by Provider, without the prior written consent
		            of Client, shall be null and void and of no effect and a material
		            breach hereof. Provider hereby agrees and consents that Client may
		            assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement, in whole or in part,
		            whether voluntary or by operation of law (including by way of sale
		            of all or substantially all of its business or assets, merger or
		            consolidation), this Agreement and the rights hereunder.
		        </li>
		        <li>
		            <strong>Severability.</strong> If any part of this Agreement is declared to be
		            invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, that part of the
		            Agreement shall be severed from this Agreement and the remainder of
		            this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.
		        </li>
		        <li>
		            <strong>Cumulative Remedies.</strong> Except as expressly provided otherwise in this
		            Agreement, in addition to any remedies provided in this Agreement,
		            the Parties shall have all remedies provided at law or in equity.
		            The rights and remedies provided in this Agreement or otherwise
		            under law or in equity shall be cumulative and the exercise of any
		            particular right or remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any
		            other rights or remedies in addition to, or as an alternative of,
		            such right or remedy, except as expressly provided otherwise in this
		            Agreement.
		        </li>
		        <li>
		            <strong>No Third-Party Beneficiaries.</strong> Nothing in this Agreement, expressed
		            or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon any
		            entity, other than the parties and those specified to be indemnified
		            hereunder, and each of the foregoing parties’ respective successors
		            and permitted assigns, any remedy or claim by reason of this
		            Agreement.
		        </li>
		        <li>
		           <strong> Construction.</strong> For all purposes of this Agreement, except as
		            otherwise expressly provided or unless the context otherwise

		            particular Appendix, Section, or other subdivision; (e) all Section
		            headings are for convenience only and shall not affect the
		            interpretation or construction of this Agreement; (f) reference to
		            any document or laws means such document or laws as amended from
		            time to time, and (g) “include” or “including” means including
