No, not fuzzy pajamas, but a significant other thatsweats buckets every night?<br><br>Are your intimate moments cut short by damp, clingy sheets?<br><br>Or ruined by odors that won’t go away, corners that keep popping off of the mattress, oraggravating itchiness?<br><br>My name is Julie Nesbitt and for years, my husband and I slept on opposite sides of the bed.<br><br>No, we weren’t fighting or tired of each other…<br><br>We were still a perfect match in almost every way!<br><br>But when it came to getting in bed, it was like jumping between the sheets with a spaceheater. I couldn’t fall asleep anywhere near him and he spent most nights tossing andturning, trying to find a cool spot left on the bed.<br><br>We even considered sleeping in separate beds sometimes, just to get a good night’s sleep.<br><br>But after we spent a weekend away at an Airbnb near my parents’ house, I had to message them and ask them what their secret was!<br>‍<br>My husband and I had the most wonderful night’s sleep we’d experienced in years. Now, of course, you expect to sleep better on vacation, in a room you don’t have to clean, with less things on your mind and fewer worries<br>‍<br>But this was different. I got to be the little spoon all night...and neither of us ever woke up!<br><br>When our alarms did go off in the morning, we both woke up refreshed, feeling clean and ready to go, the only problem was…<br><br>We were so comfortable, we didn’t want to get up!<br><br>Even my generally oblivious (I love him but you know how it is…) husband had to admit that there was something special about this bed and he encouraged me to find out what it was.<br><br>When I got a response from our host, I was surprised!<br><br>I expected their “secret” to be a fancy mattress or some kind of linens that were way out of our budget…<br><br>But when they told me about Miracle Sheets, and I looked at their website, I found a simple and affordable solution. And I wasn’t the only one...<br></p>

            <p class="t csd">We’d tried a couple of different types of “cooling” or “moisture wicking” sheets in the past. It was an expensive experiment, these sheets often costing upwards of $300 to fit our king-size bed. And the results were disappointing…<br><br>We might get a couple of nights of decent sleep but after just a few days we’d be back in the same routine of sweaty nights and damp “body prints” every morning.<br><br>One set, that cost us $329, tore after only two washes! What a waste.<br><br>Now, we’ve had our Miracle Sheets for months and we’re still sleeping great, enjoying our “us” time between the sheets, and waking up rejuvenated.<br><br>My skin is glowing every morning and my husband’s night sweats are a thing of the past.</p>

          <div class="paragraph-div">
            <p class="t gf">This is all due to one special ingredient in <a href="https://try.miraclebrand.co/sheets/lp13/" class="split_link">Miracle Brand Sheets</a>, all-natural silver. Metals like silver are scientifically proven to <strong>repel microbes and bacteria </strong><span class="text-span-26">(1)</span>. These invisible little organisms are what cause skin irritations, create odors, and give your body that “creepy crawly” feeling in bed. They also feed dust mites that can aggravate your sinuses and cause allergies. Gross!<br><br>Since ancient times, the silver ion has been known to be effective against a broad range of microorganisms. Today, silver ions are used to control bacterial growth in a variety of ways, including dental work, medical applications, catheters, and the healing of burn wounds<span class="text-span-26">(2)</span>.<br><br>Silver is used as an antibacterial substance to <strong>help surfaces basically clean themselves</strong><span class="text-span-26">(3)</span>. And when woven or infused into the fibers of your sheets, that means up to 3x less washing!<br><br>So not only are you sleeping better, is your skin healthier, and you are waking up happier…<br><br>But you’ll have less laundry to do. It’s like living (and sleeping) in a dream!<br></p>

            <p class="para-quote">This Is Why We Love Them</p>
          </div>
          <p class="t">The main things we noticed about our sheets, in addition, are that they are odor free and thermoregulating. Destroying bacteria means banishing the odors they cause<span class="text-span-26">(4)</span>. <br><br>Cotton naturally diffuses heat throughout the fabric to prevent any part of your body from getting too hot or too cold<span class="text-span-26">(5)</span>. The addition of silver helps adjust your body temperature by sorting or releasing heat as needed, allowing the sheets to be ultra breathable<span class="text-span-26">(6)</span>. <br><br>But that doesn’t mean they’re thin. These sheets are made with high-quality Supima cotton and a strong percale weave which mades them extremely durable. Plus, their deep pockets and extra strong elastic on the fitted sheet means they stay put with less wrinkles.<br></p>

              <p class="review-para">Heavenly sheets!!! They truly are a miracle. For 6 years I’ve been sleeping in a water bed each night because my husband gets too hot at night. We&#x27;ve even tried Sheex to no avail. LITERALLY the first night I put these on it was like a MIRACLE! <strong>These sheets stay cool, don&#x27;t get smelly and are ready to perform night after night</strong>.

            <p class="t">Because people are loving them so much, some boutique hotels and 5-Star Airbnbs have already switched over…<br><br>And I’ve noticed that they’re sometimes out of certain sizes or colors. But the site is constantly being re-stocked and updated.<br><br> All this to say, you should <a href="https://try.miraclebrand.co/sheets/lp13/" class="split_link">check the availability</a> now to make sure you get your set and can be on your way to better sleep at night. I promise, your husband will notice the difference!<br><br>If you sleep next to a human heating machine, struggle with irritated skin, or are just looking for a more hygienic set of sheets in general…<br><br>
